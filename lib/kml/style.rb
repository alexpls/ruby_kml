  # A Style defines an addressable style group that can be referenced by StyleMaps and Features. Styles affect 
  # how Geometry is presented in the 3D viewer and how Features appear in the Places panel of the List view. 
  # Shared styles are collected in a Document and must have an id defined for them so that they can be referenced 
  # by the individual Features that use them.
